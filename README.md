# InstaAir

InstaAir is a simple plugin which brings back the old Minecraft 1.12.2 (and below) air mechanics.    
When a player goes above water their air is instantly replenished.   
I also included a permission `"instaair.replenish"`, players with this permission will insantly replenish air, otherwise it will slowly replenish.
